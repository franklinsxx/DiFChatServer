Overview
========================================================================================
The current Dissent in Facebook project is consisted of following part.
1. A Java (AWT) based desktop chat application including both client side and server side implementation. The server side is mainly focusing on chat group and user management. Another web based chat application is under development.
2. A Dissent web server (implemented by Henry@Dedis) running dissent service (implemented by David@Dedis) for processing private data received from chat clients and send them to social gourp message post server.
3. A social (Facebook) group message post server. 
4. A Facebook application with social meta-data database for client side social data fetching and storing. The sourse code of this part is currently not included.

Usage(Editing)
========================================================================================
1. DiFSocialPostServer
java -jar "./DiFSocialPostServer/dist/DiFSocialPostServer.jar"
2. DiFChatServer:
java -jar "./DiFChatServer/dist/DiFChatServer.jar"
3. DiFChatClient:
java -jar "./DiFChatClient/dist/DiFChatClient.jar"

Since the SocialPostServer and ChatServer is running on www.frankinsong.com, you can just only run the ChatClient to test this application.
If you want to make your chat client connect to your local chat server, you need to modify the server url in the client side code.
